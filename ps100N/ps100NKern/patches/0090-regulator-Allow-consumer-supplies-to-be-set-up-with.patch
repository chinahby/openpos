/*
 *	Some technical notes:
 *
 *	The BSC FrameMaster II (or Rainbow II) is a simple very dumb
 *	frame buffer which allows to display 24 bit true color images.
 *	Each pixel is 32 bit width so it's very easy to maintain the
 *	frame buffer. One long word has the following layout:
 *	AARRGGBB which means: AA the alpha channel byte, RR the red
 *	channel, GG the green channel and BB the blue channel.
 *
 *	The FrameMaster II supports the following video modes.
 *	- PAL/NTSC
 *	- interlaced/non interlaced
 *	- composite sync/sync/sync over green
 *
 *	The resolution is to the following both ones:
 *	- 768x576 (PAL)
 *	- 768x480 (NTSC)
 *
 *	This means that pixel access per line is fixed due to the
 *	fixed line width. In case of maximal resolution the frame
 *	buffer needs an amount of memory of 1.769.472 bytes which
 *	is near to 2 MByte (the allocated address space of Zorro2).
 *	The memory is channel interleaved. That means every channel
 *	owns four VRAMs. Unfortunatly most FrameMasters II are
 *	not assembled with memory for the alpha channel. In this
 *	case it could be possible to add the frame buffer into the
 *	normal memory pool.
 *
 *	At relative address 0x1ffff8 of the frame buffers base address
 *	there exists a control register with the number of
 *	four control bits. They have the following meaning:
 *	bit value meaning
 *
 *	 0    1   0=interlaced/1=non interlaced
 *	 1    2   0=video out disabled/1=video out enabled
 *	 2    4   0=normal mode as jumpered via JP8/1=complement mode
 *	 3    8   0=read  onboard ROM/1 normal operation (required)
 *
 *	As mentioned above there are several jumper. I think there
 *	is not very much information about the FrameMaster II in
 *	the world so I add these information for completeness.
 *
 *	JP1  interlace selection (1-2 non interlaced/2-3 interlaced)
 *	JP2  wait state creation (leave as is!)
 *	JP3  wait state creation (leave as is!)
 *	JP4  modulate composite sync on green output (1-2 composite
 *	     sync on green channel/2-3 normal composite sync)
 *	JP5  create test signal, shorting this jumper will create
 *	     a white screen
 *	JP6  sync creation (1-2 composite sync/2-3 H-sync output)
 *	JP8  video mode (1-2 PAL/2-3 NTSC)
 *
 *	With the following jumpering table you can connect the
 *	FrameMaster II to a normal TV via SCART connector:
 *	JP1:  2-3
 *	JP4:  2-3
 *	JP6:  2-3
 *	JP8:  1-2 (means PAL for Europe)
 *
 *	NOTE:
 *	There is no other possibility to change the video timings
 *	except the interlaced/non interlaced, sync control and the
 *	video mode PAL (50 Hz)/NTSC (60 Hz). Inside this
 *	FrameMaster II driver are assumed values to avoid anomalies
 *	to a future X server. Except the pixel clock is really
 *	constant at 30 MHz.
 *
 *	9 pin female video connector:
 *
 *	1  analog red 0.7 Vss
 *	2  analog green 0.7 Vss
 *	3  analog blue 0.7 Vss
 *	4  H-sync TTL
 *	5  V-sync TTL
 *	6  ground
 *	7  ground
 *	8  ground
 *	9  ground
 *
 *	Some performance notes:
 *	The FrameMaster II was not designed to display a console
 *	this driver would do! It was designed to display still true
 *	color images. Imagine: When scroll up a text line there
 *	must copied ca. 1.7 MBytes to another place inside this
 *	frame buffer. This means 1.7 MByte read and 1.7 MByte write
 *	over the slow 16 bit wide Zorro2 bus! A scroll of one
 *	line needs 1 second so do not expect to much from this
 *	driver - he is at the limit!
