the
 * sequencer determines that there is a residual in the tranfer, or
 * there is non-zero status, it will set the SG_STATUS_VALID flag in
 * sgptr and dma the scb back into host memory.  To sumarize:
 *
 * Sequencer:
 *	o A residual has occurred if SG_FULL_RESID is set in sgptr,
 *	  or residual_sgptr does not have SG_LIST_NULL set.
 *
 *	o We are transfering the last segment if residual_datacnt has
 *	  the SG_LAST_SEG flag set.
 *
 * Host:
 *	o A residual can only have occurred if a completed scb has the
 *	  SG_STATUS_VALID flag set.  Inspection of the SCSI status field,
 *	  the residual_datacnt, and the residual_sgptr field will tell
 *	  for sure.
 *
 *	o residual_sgptr and sgptr refer to the "next" sg entry
 *	  and so may point beyond the last valid sg entry for the
 *	  transfer.
