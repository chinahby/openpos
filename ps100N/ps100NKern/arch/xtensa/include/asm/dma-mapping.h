 *
 * This is used to enable data transfers on interfaces that may not
 * be enabled by default.  Not all devices support such configurability.
 * Only the driver bound to an interface may change its setting.
 *
 * Within any given configuration, each interface may have several
 * alternative settings.  These are often used to control levels of
 * bandwidth consumption.  For example, the default setting for a high
 * speed interrupt endpoint may not send more than 64 bytes per microframe,
 * while interrupt transfers of up to 3KBytes per microframe are legal.
 * Also, isochronous endpoints may never be part of an
 * interface's default setting.  To access such bandwidth, alternate
 * interface settings must be made current.
 *
 * Note that in the Linux USB subsystem, bandwidth associated with
 * an endpoint in a given alternate setting is not reserved until an URB
 * is submitted that needs that bandwidth.  Some other operating systems
 * allocate bandwidth early, when a configuration is chosen.
 *
 * This call is synchronous, and may not be used in an interrupt context.
 * Also, drivers must not change altsettings while urbs are scheduled for
 * endpoints in that interface; all such urbs must first be completed
 * (perhaps forced by unlinking).
 *
 * Returns zero on success, or else the status code returned by the
 * underlying usb_control_msg() call.
